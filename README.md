# Better Command Blocks
Adds command blocks similar to those of a certain other voxel game (hereafter referred to as ACOVG). It is the only command block mod to support my [Better Commands](https://github.com/thepython10110/better_commands) mod. It includes impulse, repeating, and chain command blocks, and *should* be game-agnostic (although you kind of need Mesecons/redstone for impulse command blocks to be useful).

To use the command blocks, you must have the `better_command_blocks` priv.

## Known issues:
1. If a command block is about to run a command after a delay, and it is dug before the delay is over, it will still run.
2. Internally, command blocks *technically* face backwards because I accidentally made it that way. This will not be fixed, to keep backwards compatibility.
